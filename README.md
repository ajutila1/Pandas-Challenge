Observable Trends

Looking purely at the data arranged and provided in the exercise, there are a few noticeable trends: 1) Average math and reading scores have consistency across grades at all fifteen schools; 2) the schools spending less than $630 per student have better passing rates than those spending more than $630 per student; 3) schools with 2000-5000 students have significantly less students passing math and reading than schools with less than 2000 students; 4) lastly, charter schools seem to outperform district schools by a significant margin when looking at overall passing scores. However, there are a few blind spots and missing comparisons that are important to consider related to the subject: 1) the charter schools mostly have less than 2,200 students while all the district schools have more than 2,700; 2) missing information includes how district and charter schools are regulated both externally and internally; 3) lastly, another of the many blind spots is average income among students served by each school, which typically plays an important part in student success.
Another important trend is the amount of PhDs who had to return to finish high school, judging from the data set.
